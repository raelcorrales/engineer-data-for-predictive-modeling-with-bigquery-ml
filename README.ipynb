    "- Clean the data in `historical_taxi_rides_raw` and make a copy to **taxi_training_data_938** in the same dataset. You can use BigQuery, Dataprep, Dataflow, etc. to create this table and clean the data. Make sure your target column is called **fare_amount_828**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some helpful hints:\n",
    "- You can see the source dataset in the BQ UI - familiarize yourself with the source schema first.\n",
    "- As a hint for the data available at prediction time, familiarize yourself with the table `taxirides.report_prediction_data` which shows the format data will arrive at prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning tasks:\n",
    "- Ensure `trip_distance` is greater than **4**.\n",
    "- Remove rows where `fare_amount` is very small (less than $**3** for example).\n",
    "- Ensure that the latitudes and longitudes are reasonable for the use case.\n",
    "- Ensure `passenger_count` is greater than **4**.\n",
    "- Be sure to add `tolls_amount` and `fare_amount` to **fare_amount_828** as the target variable since total_amount includes tips.\n",
    "- Because the source dataset is large (>1 Billion rows), sample the dataset to less than 1 Million rows.\n",
    "- Only copy fields that will be used in your model (`report_prediction_data` is a good guide)."
